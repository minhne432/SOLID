The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin and stand for:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions.

These principles help in creating more robust and maintainable codebases by promoting clear and organized design patterns.
